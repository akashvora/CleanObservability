# Product Overview

CleanObservability is a .NET library and framework for implementing clean observability patterns in ASP.NET Core applications. It provides structured error handling, request correlation, logging integration, and middleware components for building observable web APIs.

## Key Features
- Structured error handling with Result patterns
- Request correlation and tracing with correlation IDs
- Integrated logging with Serilog and multiple sinks
- Multiple logging destinations (Console, File, PostgreSQL, Seq, Grafana Loki)
- Exception-to-problem-details conversion middleware
- FluentValidation integration for input validation
- Clean architecture patterns for observability
- Request context enrichment for enhanced logging

## Target Use Cases
- Building observable web APIs with structured logging
- Implementing clean error handling patterns
- Centralizing observability concerns in .NET applications
- Demonstrating best practices for logging and monitoring
- Integration with observability stacks (Grafana, Loki, Seq)
